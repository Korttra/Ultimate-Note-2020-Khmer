កំណត់ចំណាំចុងក្រោយ

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,160
វគ្គ 2

4
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,820
សូមក្រឡេកមើលគំរូនោះ។

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,940
ប្រាប់ខ្ញុំថាតើវាជាអ្វី។

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,979
តើអ្នកបានរកឃើញសូត្រពណ៌លឿងទេ?

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,660
វាគ្មានប្រយោជន៍ទេ។

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,100
Xiao Hua ។

9
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,340
ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញវាជាយូរមកហើយ។

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,460
អ្នកនឹងបញ្ចប់ដូចខ្ញុំ

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,380
ប្រសិនបើអ្នកទទូច

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,260
នៅលើការឈានដល់បាតរបស់វា។

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,660
ខ្ញុំបានចំណាយពេលពេញមួយជីវិតរបស់ខ្ញុំ
លើរឿងនេះ។ វាគ្មានប្រយោជន៍អ្វីទាំងអស់។

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,100
ស្តាប់ដំបូន្មានរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,260
Xie Yu Chen ។

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,380
អ្នក​គួរ​មើល​ថែ
​គ្រួសារ​របស់​អ្នក​ល្អ​ជាង។

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,820
តើយើងកំពុងស៊ើបអង្កេតទេ?

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,579
កូនប្រុសទីបីនៃគ្រួសារ Wu
មិនអាចជឿទុកចិត្តបានទេ។

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,660
គំរូនេះគឺនៅលើសូត្រពណ៌លឿង។

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,820
វាមិនអាចទៅរួចទេដែលគាត់មិនអើពើ។

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,940
ប្រសិនបើគាត់អាចរកឃើញអ្វីមួយចេញពីវា

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,060
ដូច្នេះយើងអាច។

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,420
តើយើងគួរចាប់ផ្តើមនៅទីណា?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
តើ​អ្នក​មិន​បាន​រក​ឃើញ​អ្វី​មួយ​ទេ។

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,660
ពីមីងរបស់អ្នក Huo Ling?

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
ទំនិញឥឡូវនេះគឺនៅក្នុង Qinghai,

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,579
នៅក្នុងភូមិមួយដែលមានឈ្មោះថា Lancuo ។

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,190
នេះគឺជា
សរសៃនាគរឿងព្រេងនិទានដែលជាកន្លែងដែល

29
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,580
អធិរាជ Mu នៃ Zhou បានបន្តភាពអមតៈ។

30
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,460
ខ្សែទាំងនេះភ្ជាប់គ្នាបង្កើតជានាគ។

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,100
ខ្ញុំយល់ហើយ បើមនុស្សបុរាណ
មានអបិយជំនឿ។

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,460
ប៉ុន្តែ តើ​អ្នក​ណា​ជឿ​រឿង​បែប​នេះ
​នៅ​ពេល​បច្ចុប្បន្ន?

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,620
កៃដា។

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,230
Qaidam, Tamutuo

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,260
ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រ Tamutuo ។

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
ហេតុ​អ្វី​បាន​ជា​កន្លែង​នេះ​តែ​មួយ​គត់

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,380
នៅខាងក្រៅទ្វារនាគ?

38
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,260
ច្រកទ្វារសំរិទ្ធ

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,700
ច្រកទ្វារសំរិទ្ធ។

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,780
Chen Wen Jin បានទៅទ្វារសំរិទ្ធ។

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,140
ថ្ងៃទី ៣០ ខែ ឧសភា ឆ្នាំ ១៩៩៣។

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,460
យើងបានទៅដល់ភ្នំ Changbai។

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,780
អាកាសធាតុមិនអាចអត់ឱនបាន។

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,820
ថ្ងៃទី 15 ខែមិថុនា។

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,020
ដោយបានបាត់បង់ទំនាក់ទំនងជាមួយក្រុម

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,460
យើងទាំងពីរបានចុច។

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,420
ថ្ងៃទី 17 ខែមិថុនា។

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,420
យើងបានទៅដល់មូលដ្ឋាន
នៃវិមានសួគ៌។

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,060
អ្វីៗមើលទៅមិនល្អទេ។

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,740
មនុស្សជាច្រើនទៀតអាចស្លាប់។

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,420
មិនមានពេលដើម្បីពិចារណាទេ។

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,100
យើងបានសម្រេចចិត្តចូលទៅក្នុងច្រកទ្វារសំរិទ្ធ។

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,660
យើងមិនអាចរង់ចាំមើលអ្វីដែលនៅខាងក្នុងនោះទេ។

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,140
ថ្ងៃទី ១៨ ខែមិថុនា ឆ្នាំ ១៩៩៣។

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,780
ខ្ញុំគិត

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
ខ្ញុំកំពុងមើល Ultimate។

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
ច្រកទ្វារសំរិទ្ធ

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,060
ទីបំផុត?

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,980
វាឈប់នៅគ្រាដ៏សំខាន់នេះ។

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,380
តើ​អ្នក​លេង​សើច​នឹង​ខ្ញុំ​ឬ?

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,140
ថ្ងៃទី 8 ខែកុម្ភៈ ឆ្នាំ 1995

62
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,420
យើងគ្រោងនឹងស្វែងរក Tamutuo។

63
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,140
ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែស្វែងយល់

64
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,060
អ្វីដែលកំពុងកើតឡើង។

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,340
តាមូទូ។

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,860
តាមូទូ។

67
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,580
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្វីៗគ្រប់យ៉ាងអំពី Tamutuo?

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,940
ភក់​ពោរពេញ​ទៅ​ដោយ​ពស់​ចឹក។

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,940
មានន័យថា​ម៉េច?

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,420
តើអ្នកជា Huo Ling មែនទេ?

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,620
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកក្លាយជាបែបនេះ?

72
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,260
នៅ​អោយ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​ខ្ញុំ!

73
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,940
នៅស្ងៀម។

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,420
លោក Zhang មែនទេ?

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,260
ខ្ញុំ​បាន​គិត​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​មិន​បាន​ជួប​អ្នក​ម្តង​ទៀត​។

76
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,460
ដាក់នាងនៅក្នុងមឈូស។

77
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,320
តើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​ធ្វើអ្វី​នៅ​ទីនេះ?

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,860
ខ្ញុំគួរតែសួរអ្នកពីរឿងនេះ។

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,540
តើអ្នកមកទីនេះដោយរបៀបណា?

80
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,460
តើអ្នកមិនបានចូលទៅក្នុងទ្វារសំរិទ្ធទេ?

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,820
តើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​ធ្វើអ្វី?

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,820
យើងនឹងចាកចេញ។

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,740
អ្នកត្រូវតែប្រាប់ខ្ញុំពីអ្វីដែលបានកើតឡើង។

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,740
តើខ្ញុំមិនបានគោរពទេ?

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,540
ទីបំផុតខ្ញុំបានទទួលវា។

86
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
ខ្ញុំបានរកឃើញប្រអប់មួយ។

87
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,380
ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកបានរកឃើញមនុស្សម្នាក់។

88
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,300
អ្នក​ឈ្នះ។

89
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,620
ខ្សែ​ក្រ​វ៉ាត់...

90
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,340
គឺជាសំរាម។

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,020
តោះ​ទៅ។

92
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,920
កន្លែងសំរាកពេទ្យ Golmud

93
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,300
រង់ចាំ​ខ្ញុំ។

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,860
ខ្ញុំ​មិន​បាន​ចូល​ឡាន​ទេ។

95
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
ឈប់ឡាន!

96
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,700
ឈប់ឡាន!

97
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,860
ហេ!

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,700
លោក Wu?

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,980
Ah Ning?

100
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,420
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកនៅក្នុងឡាន?

101
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,500
អ្នក​គ្រាន់​តែ​ធ្វើ​ពុត​ជា​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​នៅ Hangzhou ។

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,620
ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកមិនដឹងអ្វីទាំងអស់។

103
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,380
ដូច្នេះតើអ្នកពិតជាបានសាកល្បងខ្ញុំនៅពេលនោះមែនទេ?

104
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,860
មាន interlayer នៅក្នុងខ្សែវីដេអូ។

105
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,940
វាហាក់ដូចជាអ្នកបានរៀនបានល្អ។

106
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,340
រឿងល្អខ្ញុំប្រញាប់។

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
បើ​មិន​ដូច្នេះ​ទេ
​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ធ្លាក់​សម្រាប់​ល្បិច។

108
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,980
អារម្មណ៍គឺទៅវិញទៅមក។

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,780
តើអ្នកបានរកឃើញអ្វីនៅក្នុង sanatorium?

110
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,460
រកមិនឃើញមុនខ្ញុំទេ?

111
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,100
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកនៅ
ជាមួយមនុស្សទាំងនេះ?

112
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,660
តើអ្នកចេញពីទ្វារសំរិទ្ធនៅពេលណា?

113
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,940
ប្រាប់​ពូក​យើង​មក។ ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ដឹង។

114
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,380
អ្នកមិនចាកចេញពីទីនេះ
ដោយមិនប្រាប់ខ្ញុំទេ។

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,460
ប្រាប់​ខ្ញុំ!

116
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,380
អ្នកបានយកខ្សែក្រវ៉ាត់របស់ខ្ញុំ។

117
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,300
ខ្ញុំត្រូវការអ្វីមួយសម្រាប់ខោរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,420
អ្នកអាចប្រាប់ខ្ញុំពីមុនមក។

119
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,420
លោក Zhang ។

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,500
ខ្ញុំ​មាន​វា។

121
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,760
តើ​អ្នក​ឆ្កួត​ទេ?

122
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,900
តើអ្នករត់ពន្ធវ៉ែនតាមែនទេ?

123
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,680
ខ្ញុំ​មាន​អ្វី​សម្រាប់​អ្នក។

124
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,660
ខ្សែ​ក្រ​វ៉ាត់។

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,880
វាធ្វើពីស្បែកគោ

126
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,220
ហើយវាជាគុណភាពកំពូល។

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ឱ្យ​អ្នក

128
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
តម្លៃពិសេស។

129
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,200
RMB444 ។ តើអ្នកនិយាយអ្វី?

130
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
អត់អី​ទេ​អរគុណ​ហើយ។

131
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,960
ខ្សែនេះល្អគ្រប់គ្រាន់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។

132
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
រង់ចាំ។

133
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,920
តម្លៃ​ពាក់​ក​ណ្តា​ល។

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
RMB222។

135
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,580
តើអ្នកជានរកអ្នកណា?

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,900
ស្រមោល។

137
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,020
ត្រូវបានគេស្គាល់ផងដែរនៅក្នុងអាជីវកម្មថាជា Mr Black ។

138
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
Zhang Qi Ling និងគាត់

139
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,740
គឺជាអ្នកប្រឹក្សារបស់យើងសម្រាប់បេសកកម្មនេះ។

140
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,140
ទីប្រឹក្សា?

141
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,980
Zhang គឺជាអ្នកប្រឹក្សារបស់អ្នក?

142
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,340
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាពួកគេ?

143
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,140
ពួកគេបានដាក់ឈ្មោះតម្លៃរបស់ពួកគេ។

144
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,740
ពូទីបីរបស់អ្នកអាចមានលទ្ធភាពទិញពួកគេ។

145
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,820
ខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ។

146
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,300
វូ ឡៅស៊ី ធ្វើ​ឲ្យ​លឿន។

147
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,020
មានលុយនឹងធ្វើដំណើរ។

148
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,460
ខ្ញុំនឹងធ្វើអ្វីដើម្បីលុយ។

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,460
ដូច្នេះចុះយ៉ាងណាចំពោះគូមួយ?

150
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,900
វានឹងមានប្រយោជន៍នៅវាលខ្សាច់នៅពេលក្រោយ។

151
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,620
វាលខ្សាច់?

152
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,940
តើអ្នកមិនដឹងទេ?

153
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,540
យើងនឹងទៅ Tamutuo ។

154
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,780
តាមូទូ?

155
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,580
តើអ្នកនៅតែចង់បានវាទេ?

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
Qaidam, Tamutuo

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,940
អ្នកអាចទុកវាសម្រាប់ខ្លួនអ្នក។

158
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,260
ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ដឹងអ្វីមួយ។

159
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,260
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាក្រុមទៅ Tamutuo?

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,060
អ្នកអាចហៅខ្ញុំថា Lao Gao។

161
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,620
ចៅហ្វាយបានប្រាប់យើងតាមទូ

162
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,940
គឺជារាជធានីនៃដែនដី
នៃមាតានៃស្ថានសួគ៌។

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,820
នោះ​ហើយ​ជា​កន្លែង​ដែល​ព្រះ​បរម​រាជវាំង
​នៃ​មាតា​នៃ​ស្ថាន​សួគ៌។

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,540
ព្រះបរមរាជវាំងមាតានៃស្ថានសួគ៌?

165
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,180
តេ​ី​យេ​ី​ង​ទៅ​ទីនោះ​ដោយ​របៀបណា?

166
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,980
I need to check out the things they've
brought over from the sanatorium.

167
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,460
Thanks.

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
The old lady

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,140
used to be the guide for
Chen Wen Jin's archaeological team.

170
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,540
Her name is Madam Dolma.

171
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,340
This porcelain plate is
from the sanatorium.

172
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,760
Once the archaeological team
began their journey from Da Qaidam

173
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,420
and entered the Qarhan area,

174
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,740
they could never find the way in again.

175
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,820
Couldn't find the way in?

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,940
Yes.

177
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,860
They had reached Tamutuo.

178
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,580
Also known as Tarmusto.

179
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,980
It means the ghost town in the rain.

180
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,740
Legend has it that it only
appears during heavy rain.

181
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,220
What happened next?

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,420
Nobody knows.

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,820
The old lady is our only clue.

184
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,580
This porcelain plate

185
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,900
was a token of love between
her and Chen Wen Jin.

186
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,460
On it is a map that shows
the route to Tamutuo.

187
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,380
Tashi.

188
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,860
The plate is missing part of its lip.
It's incomplete.

189
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,340
We can't go there.

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
We can't go?

191
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
My granny said
the plate is incomplete.

192
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,740
We couldn't go without the missing part.

193
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,340
Do you know where the
missing pieces are?

194
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,620
Do you know where to
find the missing parts?

195
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,420
They were taken to Lancuo.

196
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,860
They were taken to Lancuo.

197
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,140
To Lancuo.

198
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,850
Zhang!

199
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,100
Looks like

200
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,420
he has something to tell you.

201
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,740
Why don't I go there?

202
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,700
Sounds like a pastoral farming community.

203
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,540
Just my kind of place.

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,660
Go back.

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,540
Fine.

206
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,100
I'll go back.

207
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,020
But you must answer
my questions before that.

208
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,260
I'm also seeking the answers.

209
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,860
Having an argument?

210
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,100
Are you eavesdropping on us?

211
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,220
That's rude.

212
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm in charge here.

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,460
If you're unhappy,

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,140
you can just go.

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,260
When are you leaving for Tamutuo?

216
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,260
Once we have the whole map.

217
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,940
Fine.

218
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,460
I'll go with the team.

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
Don't ever think

220
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,180
of leaving me behind.

221
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,060
In case you're thinking of reporting us,

222
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
our expedition

223
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,580
has already been approved.

224
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,420
Let me tell you something.

225
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,500
Chen Wen Jin actually wanted me to go

226
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,460
since the videotapes were sent to me.

227
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,180
In other words,

228
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,260
Chen Wen Jin needed me to go.

229
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,380
Are you hiding something?

230
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,740
Aren't you doing the same?

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,620
Your life matters to him,

232
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,660
but not to me.

233
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,940
Just come with us.

234
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,120
Is this the one?

235
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,100
Yes.

236
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,060
That's a nice painting.

237
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
My father left me that painting.

238
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,300
Is it for sale?

239
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,580
No.

240
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,020
Family heirlooms aren't for sale.

241
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,700
Not even for

242
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,100
a thousand.

243
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,100
How about five times of that?

244
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,380
Five times?

245
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,660
Do you accept credit cards?

246
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,860
Sure.

247
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,360
My motorcycle!

248
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,340
It's on fire!

249
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,260
Let's go.

250
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,500
What happened?

251
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,540
How could this happen to me?

252
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,820
It's gone.

253
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm really not willing to sell
the stuff my father left me.

254
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,140
Don't worry.

255
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,980
I'll throw in another thousand.

256
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,460
That should cover your motorcycle.

257
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,780
Let me tell you something.

258
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,960
There's a story

259
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,900
behind the painting.

260
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,940
That blind man.

261
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,140
Let's go.

262
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,140
He's a fake.

263
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,980
Five thousand

264
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,460
for that piece.

265
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,460
Why do you want this?

266
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,500
Let's have a talk.

267
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,900
No.

268
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,220
Come on.

269
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,220
No.

270
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,900
Let's have a talk.

271
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,460
No.

272
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,420
Are you sure?

273
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,980
No.

274
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,140
Wake up.

275
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,740
Come with me. My granny wants to see you.

276
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,260
Madam Dolma wants to see me?

277
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,700
Please take a seat.

278
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,540
Please take a seat.

279
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Tashi.

280
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,540
Serve the tea.

281
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,260
Chen Wen Jin has a message for you.

282
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,600
My granny says

283
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,380
Chen Wen Jin has a message for you.

284
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,100
Chen Wen Jin shall await you all at the
Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

285
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,020
But you have only ten days.

286
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,480
Otherwise, Chen Wen Jin will enter alone.

287
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,880
You don't have much time.

288
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,380
Make haste.

289
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,140
Chen Wen Jin shall await you all at the
Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

290
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,560
But if you couldn't make it in ten days,

291
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,980
Chen Wen Jin will enter alone.

292
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,680
You don't have much time.

293
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,660
Make haste.

294
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,140
When did Chen Wen Jin tell you about this?

295
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,620
When did Chen Wen Jin tell you about this?

296
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,920
I only convey the message.

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,400
That's all I know.

298
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,780
And that's all I can tell you.

299
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,480
Others could be watching us.

300
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,680
My granny says she's only
conveying the message.

301
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,060
That's all she knows.

302
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,220
And that's all she can say.

303
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,100
Others could be watching us.

304
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,300
Madam,

305
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,220
why does Chen Wen Jin want me to go?

306
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,260
Why does Chen Wen Jin want Wu Xie to go?

307
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,880
Chen Wen Jin said the
object is in your midst.

308
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,580
Be wary.

309
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,380
Chen Wen Jin said

310
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,340
the object is in your midst.

311
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,900
Be wary.

312
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Did you wonder

313
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,660
why Chen Wen Jin only conveys
the message to the two of us?

314
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,380
Wait.

315
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,100
I'll ask you again.

316
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,580
Why did you enter the Bronze Gate?

317
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,740
When did you come out and
why didn't you contact me?

318
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,060
-Why can't you tell me?
-It's my personal affair.

319
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,820
Why should I?

320
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,220
You're right.

321
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,780
It's your personal affair.

322
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,700
You're not obliged to tell me.

323
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
You shouldn├втВмтДвt get involved.

324
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,980
Your third uncle

325
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,140
has already done so much for you.

326
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,580
What I want is simple.

327
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,740
If I can know
what's actually going on,

328
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,100
I'll be satisfied.

329
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,700
However, no one's telling me a word.

330
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,180
Do you know the pain
of not knowing?

331
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,980
I know it better than you.

332
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,340
I know you want to remember the past, too.

334
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,260
I don't have a past or a future.

335
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,380
If I'm gone from this world,

336
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,580
nobody will notice it.

337
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,820
If you're gone,

338
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,100
at least I'll know.

339
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,900
Can't you answer me one question?

340
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,980
What did you see beyond the Bronze Gate?

341
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,940
The Ultimate.

342
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,340
The end of everything.

343
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,260
What's the Ultimate?

344
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,380
I'm at your side.

345
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,620
Actually, your problem

346
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,220
is already my problem.

347
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,260
If the Palace of the Heavenly
Queen Mother has all the answers,

348
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,420
then I must continue the journey with you.

349
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,740
Let me tell you.

350
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,580
The porcelain pieces

351
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,380
are of no use to you.

352
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,340
They're worthless.

353
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,260
Money isn't an issue to me.

354
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
Fine.

355
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,580
Cheers.

356
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,370
Why are you here?

357
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,220
Wu Xie? Come.

358
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,780
Let me introduce you.

359
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,800
Our guest here is an antique dealer

360
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,860
from the Xie family...

361
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,780
Aren't you from the Wu family?

362
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,620
Shouldn't you two know each other?

363
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,340
You're from the Xie family?

364
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,800
We used to play together when we were kids

365
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,900
during the New Year.

366
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,540
You're Xiao Hua?

367
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,140
Isn't Xiao Hua a girl?

368
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,900
That's right.

369
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,300
You transitioned?

370
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,460
I was too pretty as a kid, that's all.

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
And you must be Huo Xiu Xiu.

372
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,860
That's me.

373
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,780
What brings you guys here?

374
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,560
It's great that you all know each other.

375
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,540
Wait.

376
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,900
-Have a seat.
-Have a seat.

377
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,240
Wu Xie, this buddy of yours

378
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,580
has two porcelain pieces.

379
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,700
We need those for our trip to Tamutuo.

380
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,620
What do you need these for?

381
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,620
The leader of the camp is Ah Ning.

382
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,620
She has a broken porcelain plate

383
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,020
and you have the missing pieces.

384
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,660
Together, they form a map to Tamutuo.

385
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,100
We're going there, too.

386
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,780
Why don't you let us meet your boss?

387
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,860
I want to talk to her.

388
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,260
Are you looking down on me?

389
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,460
Cheers.

390
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,140
I know you're from the Xie family.

391
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,780
And you're from the Huo family.

392
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,220
Both of you belong to the Mystic Nine.

393
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,520
Even if I disagree,

394
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,860
you'd still go to Tamutuo.

395
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,140
And you're holding the porcelain pieces.

396
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,900
I can take you there.

397
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,740
But under one condition.

398
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,900
Once inside Tamutuo,

399
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,220
you'll listen to me.

400
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,460
It's a deal.

401
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,300
One more thing.

402
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,860
I won't be paying your expenses.

403
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,820
You're charging us now?

404
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,740
A videotape brought me to Golmud.

405
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,620
Now a porcelain plate is taking me

406
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,180
to Tamutuo in search of the Palace
of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

407
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
Is this some kind of game

408
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,460
by our ancestors?

409
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,660
Videotape?

410
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,580
The videotape itself is
just smoke and mirrors.

411
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,980
The gist

412
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,100
is within its case.

413
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,940
The clue is in a videotape.

414
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,900
The Yellow Silk indicates
Tamutuo's location.

415
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,420
It should be the Palace

416
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,100
according to what they've said.

417
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,860
I can't find the entrance by myself.

418
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,200
I need them to try their luck.

419
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,820
Then just go with them.

420
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,040
What about you?

421
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,640
I've seen that videotape

422
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,140
Wu Xie mentioned at my granny's.

423
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,820
She has kept it well.

424
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,700
I think there are more
important clues in the videotape.

425
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,840
That's a good idea, too.

426
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,220
We'll split up.

427
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,360
One of us is bound to make it.

428
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,340
Very well.

429
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,860
One more thing.

430
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,720
Beware of the one in shades.

431
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,340
I have a bad feeling about him.

432
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,900
Don't worry. He won't be a threat.

433
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,220
Drive safe.

434
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,260
Lao Gao, can't you drive more steadily?

435
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Your buddy here is doing fine.

436
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,620
Why don't you ride a camel?

437
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,800
By the way, where's that cool girl?

438
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,920
Something came up at home.

439
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,060
She left last night.

440
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,040
What came up?

441
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440
She forgot to turn off the stove

442
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,140
before leaving home.

443
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,380
Oh, I see.

444
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
It's a pity.

445
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,820
She's missing out on the scenery.

446
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,340
Wu Xie.

447
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,880
Why aren't you in the same car
as the one who rarely speaks?

448
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,820
Aren't you avoiding the one in shades?

449
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,220
Let the blind man and the mute

450
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,780
enjoy their time together.

451
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,060
You're daring.

452
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,380
Aren't you worried
Ah Ning will leave without you

453
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,020
after you gave
her the porcelain pieces?

454
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,820
If she's willing to let you come,

455
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,620
she's willing to let anyone come.

456
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,260
The weather is changing.

457
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,060
The wind is coming. Stay in formation.

458
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
Stop your cars. Put on your gears.

459
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,860
Get out.

460
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,980
Stop the car.

461
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,340
Otherwise, we'll be buried.

462
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,860
Stop the car, quick!

463
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,700
Anyone?

464
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Anyone?

465
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,460
Anyone?

466
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,980
Do you hear me?

467
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,420
The signal's too weak. We
lost contact with them.

468
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,820
Do you hear me?

469
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,620
Stop all your cars!

470
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Has everyone stopped?

471
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,220
Answer me.

472
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,380
Stop driving if you want to live.

473
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,300
Let's get out.

474
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
The rest of the gear is in the trunk.

475
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,260
It's too late.

476
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,140
Cover your face.

477
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,820
Cover your face with the bags.

478
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,420
Let's get out of here!

479
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,880
The wind is too strong.

480
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,320
Our visibility is too poor.

481
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
They may not be able to locate us.

482
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
If the sand level reaches
Mute Zhang's sword's hilt,

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,100
then we need to take cover
somewhere.

484
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,880
Let's get out of the car.

485
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,280
Get out of the car now.

486
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,820
Do it now!

487
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,420
Follow me closely, don't get stranded.

488
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,220
The visibility is getting worse!

489
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,380
We need to find somewhere safer.

490
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,620
Look over there!

491
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,580
Signal flare.

492
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,760
Where's the compass?

493
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,739
Check the direction.

494
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,580
125 ដឺក្រេភាគអាគ្នេយ៍។

495
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,860
សៀវភៅ​ខ្ញុំ!

496
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,620
-សៀវភៅ​ខ្ញុំ!
- ឡៅ កៅ!

497
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
គាត់កាន់ត្រីវិស័យ។

498
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,460
គាត់អាចស្វែងរកផ្លូវរបស់គាត់។

499
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,460
តោះទៅម្តង ហើយចូលរួមជាមួយអ្នកដទៃ។

500
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,620
តោះ​ទៅ។

501
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,500
យើង​ត្រូវ​តែ​ចូល​ទៅ។

502
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,620
យើង​បាន​បញ្ជូន​សញ្ញា, បិទ​ Zhang ។

503
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,040
ហើយស្នែងគឺនៅក្នុងខ្សាច់។

504
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,300
យើងគួរតែផ្លាស់ទី។

505
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,660
ខ្ញុំនឹងស្នាក់នៅ។

506
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,680
យើងត្រូវទៅជាមួយគ្នា។

507
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,360
ដោយសារខ្ញុំជាមនុស្សចិត្តល្អ

508
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,300
ខ្ញុំនឹងនៅជាមួយអ្នកមិនអីទេ?

509
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,100
ខ្ញុំនៅតែមានកាំភ្លើងបាញ់ជាមួយខ្ញុំ។

510
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,380
យើងនឹងរង់ចាំប្រាំនាទី អតិបរមា។

511
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,060
Wu Xie, សញ្ញាឆេះ។

512
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,420
- តោះផ្លាស់ទីវា។
-យល់ព្រម។

513
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,780
ខ្យល់កំពុងចុះខ្សោយ។

514
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,260
ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា

515
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,700
វានឹងមកម្តងទៀត។

516
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,820
យើងត្រូវស្វែងរកកន្លែងដែលមានសុវត្ថិភាពជាង។

517
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,600
យើង​ត្រូវ​តែ​ចូល​ទៅ។

518
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,800
ប៉ុន្តែ​ព្យុះ​ខ្សាច់​កំពុង​ឈូស​ឆាយ។

519
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,660
ចុះបើគេមករកយើង?

520
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,040
ខ្ញុំនឹងចងកាំភ្លើងភ្លើងនៅទីនេះ។

521
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,960
ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលពួកគេមក

522
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,940
ពួកគេនឹងដឹងថាយើងនៅជិត។

523
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,860
យើងត្រូវស្វែងរកចំណុចប្រជុំមួយ
Mute Zhang ។

524
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,400
នៅពេលដែលព្យុះខ្សាច់បានបញ្ចប់។

525
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,820
យើងនឹងស្វែងរកពួកគេ។

526
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,020
តោះ​ទៅ។

527
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,770
ប្រយ័ត្ន។

528
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,380
ខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ។

529
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,380
តទៅទៀត។

530
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,220
ខ្ញុំ​និយាយ,

531
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,020
តោះសម្រាក។

532
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,980
ដើរនៅវាលខ្សាច់

533
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,860
វាដូចជាការដើរជាមួយថង់ខ្សាច់ 50 គីឡូក្រាម។

534
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,300
វូ ស៊ី។

535
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,940
យើង​មាន​ដំណឹង​អាក្រក់។

536
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,220
យើង​មិន​បាន​ឃើញ​ភ្លើង​ឆេះ​មួយ​រយៈ​នេះ​ទេ។

537
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,300
ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងដើរខុសផ្លូវ។

538
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,380
ខ្ញុំមានដំណឹងល្អសម្រាប់អ្នក។

539
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,820
មើលងាយ។

540
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,660
ខ្សាច់រហ័ស។

541
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,580
វាធំទូលាយនៅទីនេះ។

542
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,580
និងទីជម្រក។

543
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,260
យើងគួរតែមានសុវត្ថិភាពនៅទីនេះ។

544
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,380
នេះនឹងជាចំណុចប្រជុំរបស់យើង។

545
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,810
ខ្ញុំនឹងស្វែងរក Wu Xie ។

546
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,700
រកមើលនៅទីនោះ Wu Xie ។

547
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,400
អ្នកអាចមើលឃើញកន្លែងដែលខ្សាច់សើមបញ្ចប់។

548
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,100
ត្រូវតែជាគែមនៃដីខ្សាច់។

549
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,760
បាត់បង់កាបូប។

550
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,640
យើងអាចយកពួកវាមកវិញ

551
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,220
- ប្រសិនបើយើងមានសំណាង។
-យល់ព្រម។

552
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,700
បោះវាឥឡូវនេះ។

553
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,940
លាតដៃរបស់អ្នកចេញ
ហើយដើរកាត់ខ្សាច់។

554
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,420
យល់ព្រម។

555
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,120
ខ្ញុំរួចរាល់ហើយ Wu Xie

556
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,100
តោះ​ធ្វើ​វា។

557
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,860
មួយ​ពីរ​បី។

558
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,660
តោះ​ទៅ។

559
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,020
ខ្ញុំក៏ទៅដែរ។

560
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,380
ទីបំផុត​យើង​បាន​រក​ឃើញ​ទី​ជម្រក។

561
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,840
អ្នក​ស្នាក់នៅ។

562
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,040
យើងនឹងទៅយកគាត់។

563
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,020
ទេ

564
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,880
ខ្ញុំត្រូវស្វែងរក Madam Dolma ។

565
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
បើគេមកទីនេះ
ហើយមិនឃើញយើង

566
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,420
យើងនឹងបែកគ្នាម្តងទៀត។

567
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,460
យើងត្រូវតែស្វែងរក Madam Dolma ។

568
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,420
កុំបារម្ភចៅហ្វាយ។

569
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,660
ខ្ញុំមិនអាចបន្តបានទេ។

570
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,700
បន្ទាប់ពីដីខ្សាច់

571
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,920
និងការធ្វើដំណើរដ៏វែងមួយ

572
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,700
ខ្ញុំ​វាយ​ស្លាប់។ តោះសម្រាក។

573
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,420
វូ ស៊ី។

574
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,460
យើងត្រូវរកទីជំរក។

575
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,940
បើមិនដូច្នេះទេ យើងនឹងបង្កករហូតដល់ស្លាប់។

576
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,820
ខ្ញុំមិនអាចទេ។

577
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,620
ខ្ញុំត្រូវការទឹកខ្លះ។

578
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,020
ខ្ញុំ​អស់​ទឹក។

579
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,620
យកនេះ។

580
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,140
ខ្ញុំនឹកផ្ទះ។

581
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,500
You can't sleep now, Wu Xie.

582
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,020
I can't.

583
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,060
I need to take a rest first.

584
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,180
Wu Xie.

585
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,630
Wake up.

586
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,170
Wu Xie.

587
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:43,004
